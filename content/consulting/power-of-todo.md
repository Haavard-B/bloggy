## Course schedule

The course spans over 6 months, allowing for flexibility while learning.

MAYBE !! and the majority of the progress will be driven by your commitment and effort.

Throughout the course, you'll engage in daily practice to reinforce the
topics you have learned in order to develop long lasting habits.

And if you have any questions, I will always be available. *(even after the course)*

# Course plan

## (1) - Pre-Introduction

Before the actual introduction, I will send you a few questions via email.
This will make it easier for me to know where you are currently at.

## (1) - Introduction

A 30-60 minute talk about who you are, your goals, then introduce the core concepts of effective task management.

## (1) - "Homework"

After the first introduction, you are given some tasks.

Some easy, some not so easy

I will do a regular checkup, while you work on applying your new skillset on a daily basis.
*(In other words, Practice by doing.)*

## (1) - 30-60 minute recap of your first 2-3 weeks

The next meeting will be a deeper dive, and a recap.

After the first few weeks, we'll schedule a session to review your progress, discuss challenges, and identify areas for improvement. Your feedback is invaluable in shaping the course to meet your needs.

## (1) - Repeat

We will do this loop until you have reached a strong understanding of how to work stress-free.
