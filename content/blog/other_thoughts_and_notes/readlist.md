- James, W. (1890). The Principles of Psychology. (A foundational work in psychology, this book covers a wide range of topics, including consciousness, memory, emotions, and willpower. James provides a comprehensive overview of psychological principles and is considered one of the founding texts of modern psychology.)
- Freud, S. (1930). Civilization and Its Discontents. (Freud examines the tension between individual desires and societal expectations. He explores how civilization requires individuals to repress certain instincts, and how this repression causes inner conflict and psychological distress.)
- Jung, C. G. (1964). Man and His Symbols. (Jung’s exploration of the unconscious mind and its influence on human behaviour. The book introduces Jungian concepts like archetypes, the collective unconscious, and the importance of symbols in psychological development.)
- Berger, P. L., & Luckmann, T. (1966). The Social Construction of Reality. (This work focuses on how knowledge and reality are created through social interactions. It introduces the concept of social constructionism, showing how societal norms and beliefs shape individual behaviour and perceptions of reality.)
- Kahneman, D. (2011). Thinking, Fast and Slow.  
  (Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman explains the dual-system theory of thought: System 1, fast and intuitive, and System 2, slow and deliberate. The book explores how these two systems influence decision-making and human judgment.)
- Jung, C. G. (1921). Psychological Types. (Jung's seminal work in which he develops his theory of personality types. The book introduces concepts such as introversion, extraversion, and the psychological functions that form the basis of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).)
- Merleau-Ponty, M. (1942). The Structure of Behaviour. (Merleau-Ponty’s philosophical work explores the relationship between the mind and the body, emphasizing perception and the embodied experience of the world. It is a key text in phenomenological psychology.)
- Skinner, B. F. (1971). Beyond Freedom and Dignity. (In this controversial work, Skinner argues that the concepts of free will and human dignity should be reconsidered in light of his behaviourist principles. He suggests that societal control and reinforcement are necessary to improve human behaviour and progress.)
- Lewin, K. (1936). Principles of Topological Psychology. (Kurt Lewin’s work in social psychology and field theory, where he explores how an individual’s behaviour is influenced by both internal forces and the external environment. His field theory emphasizes the dynamic interaction between the person and the situation.)
- Cialdini, R. B. (1984). Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion. (Cialdini explores the six universal principles of influence—reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity—that guide human behaviour in social and professional contexts. This book is a key resource for understanding persuasion psychology.)
- Damasio, A. (1994). Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain. (Damasio argues that emotions are crucial to rational decision-making, challenging the traditional dichotomy between reason and emotion. He discusses how the brain integrates emotion and cognition, fundamentally altering our understanding of human behavior and decision-making.)
- Brooks, D. (2015). The Road to Character. (Brooks examines the development of moral character and how modern society emphasizes résumé virtues over eulogy virtues. The book explores the psychology behind developing virtues such as humility, resilience, and integrity.)
