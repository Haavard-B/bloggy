In designing my exercise plan, I aim to cover most aspects of what you would consider a well-rounded, balanced approach to exercise, albeit with an intense schedule. I have broken my routine into four key areas: Gym, Cardio, Mobility and Recovery, and Climbing-focused exercises. Each play of these are independent of one another, serving its own purpose and with its own specific goals. While I do not exercise to achieve any explicit or significant goals, I know each area and their respective sessions will benefit me in some way down the road, and I thereby utilise goal-setting to motivate myself to improve in each singular session. 

Considering the intensity of the sessions of each exercise-area, I view my overall exercise-methodology to be flexible and non-dogmatic. The exercise-plan is never fully set in stone, and is adjustable to account for injuries and changes in general health, shifts in schedule, and other factors. Although the weekly exercise-schedule is initially planned at the start of each week or the end of the previous week, it may be modified when needed. This approach ensures my own discipline towards the plan, as well as the plan's effectivity. 

Throughout each week, I make sure to meticulously note down the details of each session, including the specific weights, sets and repetitions performed. I utilise these notes to ensure [progressive overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload) by reviewing my notes in advance of each session. This allows me to easily swap out insufficient exercises and systematically increase the intensity of my workouts by making incremental adjustments based on my notes, ensuring that I am consistently pushing my limits and promoting continuous improvements.

With these ideas in mind, I will now explore the specifics of my routine. In the following sections, I will provide a detailed breakdown of each key area, highlighting how they contribute to my overall fitness goals, as well as provide thorough insights into the structure of my weekly plan. For a deeper dive into my motivation, methodology and the principles guiding my exercise strategy, feel free to reed about [my exercise philosophy](https://haavard.netlify.app/content/blog/other_thoughts_and_notes/workoutphilosophy).

The following table outlines my weekly exercise schedule before any potential adjustment:

#### Gym
I structure my gym sessions into three primary groups: `Chest, Shoulders and Triceps`, `Back and Biceps` and ` Legs`. This approach allows me to focus intensively on specific muscle groups while providing ample recovery time before targeting the same areas again. By concentrating on different muscle groups each session, I can easily ensure that each group receives the attention needed, as well as a balanced workout each week. 

These session are the cornerstones of my exercise-plan. I avoid dropping a gym-session at almost any cost and refuse to have a relatively 'weak performance' in these sessions given my body 'allows' it, and will instead adjust every other session around them. For instance, as of 09.09.2024, I am dealing with knots in each calves, limiting the intensity and methods used to train them. To manage this, I will opt for even-lower-intensity cardio session and mobility-sessions with a larger focus on calves, ensuring that I can push myself more effectively in my gym-sessions. This approach allows me to maintain the integrity of my gym-sessions while adapting to any temporary challenges, ensuring consistent progress and performance across my exercise-plan,

For each session, I am to perform 3-4 sets per exercise, opting for 3 sets if I am feeling more fatigued and 4 sets otherwise. I typically work within the 8-12 repetition range, and if I find myself reaching 12 reps for 3-4 sets, I will increase the weight until I can perform a minimum of 6-8 repetition for the same number of sets. Specifically, six repetition are mostly reserved for specific 'compound' exercises such as pulldowns and belt squats, where this range is more suitable to maximise strength and muscle engagement.

I also emphasise a progressive approach to warming up and increasing weights before hitting the target weight for each exercise during each session. For example, if I plan to do 90kg pulldowns, I start with lighter weights - 10kg, then 40kg, followed by 60kg - before finally reaching 90kg. I perform one set at each weight increment, gradually building up to the target weight for that session. During these warm-up sets, I typically work within a repetition range of 6-12. This approach ensures a proper technique and gradually prepares the muscles and joints for heavier loads, reducing the risk of injury. 

[Drop sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_set) are also frequently incorporated into my training regimen, particularly as the final 1-2 sets for specific exercises. After pushing an exercise to failure, or in some cases past it by performing several half-repetitions, I reduce the weight and continue the set, which allows me to push through the last bit of exhaustion. This technique not only intensifies the workout but also helps me feel like I have maximised my efforts and thoroughly fatigued my muscles.

In recent weeks, I’ve been considering a change to my workout routine, with a goal of six gym sessions per week organized into two sets of push/pull/legs. However, given my current health concerns, this plan isn’t feasible right now. Additionally, due to time constraints regarding how much time I want to dedicate to workouts each day, I may need to adjust my overall strategy, as I prefer not to work out two to three times a day or spend up to three hours daily exercising.

The following sub-chapters provide a detailed description of each primary group:
( * refers to it being a 'secondary' muscle group utilised in the exercise, and DS = Inclined to using drop-sets in the exercise)
(There may be faults in the 'Primary Muscle Groups' categorisation)

Other exercises previously used within this group includes: Weighted Pullups, Lever Rows, Barbell Rows, Cable Rows, Cable Pulldown, Uni-lateral Internal Rotation, and other varieties of the exercises above.

Note* Barbell Deadlifts are used on-and-off depending on the state of my lower-back 'problems'. I have also decided to include various exercises focusing on shoulders as a means to prevent common shoulder injuries by improving stability, strengthening the rotator cuff, and balancing muscle development around the shoulder joint.


##### Legs

Other exercises previously used within this group includes: Laying Hamstring Curls, Uni-lateral Standing Leg Curls, Sissy Squats (Led to mild knee pain, and strained lower back muscles), Barbell Hip-thrust (Crushed my pinkie under the plates), Belt Squat (Belt hurt), Plate-loaded Leg Press, and other varieties of the exercises above.

Recently, I have been experiencing discomfort in my lower back, prompting me to create an adjusted version of my leg sessions that swaps out exercises which place excessive strain on that area, exercises that require significant stabilization, or exercises that involve multiple joints. Additionally, the weights utilised in specific exercises, such as Pendulum Squats and Hip Thrusts, are naturally reduced to ensure proper form throughout the exercises.

#### Cardio
I organise my cardio-sessions into three intensity levels: `Low-Intensity`, `Medium-Intensity` and `High-Intensity`. This structure allows me to vary the pace and distance depending on my recovery. In terms of terrain, I remain flexible - Anything goes as long as its not overly steep, though I prefer gravel roads when easily accessible. Before and after each run, regardless of intensity level, I also always incorporate a short mobility session. This routine helps prepare the body for the session ahead, and aids in recovery, easing muscle tension and promotes flexibility afterwards.

<content-table :headers="['Exercise', 'Details', 'Additional Comments']" :rows="[
    ['Low-intensity cardio', '3-5km at a pace of 6-8 minutes per km depending on the distance', ''],
    ['Medium-intensity cardio', '3-8km at pace of 5-7 minutes per km depending on the distance', ''],
    ['High-intensity cardio', '3-5km at a pace of < 5 minutes per km depending on the distance', 'Due to persisting knots in my calves, this is not included in the plan'],
]">
</content-table>


#### Mobility and Recovery
I incorporate a combination of yoga and stretching exercises into my regular mobility and recovery sessions. This practice focuses on improving flexibility and easing muscle tension, targeting key areas like the wrists, forearms, chest, shoulders, back, abs, legs, and hips. By consistently performing these exercises, I aim to maintain overall body flexibility, and support short- and long-term recovery. These sessions are integral to my routine, ensuring that I remain agile and reduce stiffness, which in turn helps me perform better in various physical activities and recover more efficiently from them.

I regularly adjust the entire mobility and recovery program based on my specific needs. For instance, if I experience significant stiffness in my forearms and wrists, I might shift the focus of the program to address these areas more intensively for a period. Such changes are temporary, but they ensure that I effectively manage and alleviate any discomfort. Despite these adjustments, the overall integrity of the mobility and recovery program remains intact. The core structure and balance of the sessions are preserved, ensuring that all key muscle groups continue to be addressed regularly.

#### Climbing-focused Sessions
My Climbing-focused sessions are split into `Interval Core- and Finger-exercises`, where I focus on strength and conditioning, and `Bouldering Sessions`, where I work through a structured programme to improve my general climbing skills. Unlike my other sessions, both of these sessions have a specific purpose: they are designed to enhance my climbing performance, helping me tackle higher grades and refine my technique. By concentrating on targeted strength and skill development, these sessions directly contribute to my progress as a climber. While I do not have a set long-term goal of, for example, climbing an 8a within a 5 year time-span, I do have short-term goals of being able to climb the next higher grade from what I am currently climbing. As of September 2024, the current goal is to climb a 7a before the end of 2024.




##### Interval Core- and Finger-exercises
For my Core and Finger-exercises, I incorporate interval training with 4 cycles, where I focus on maintaining proper and controlled techniques throughout. In these exercises the aim is not push myself to technical failure, but instead to adhere to a standardised and strict regimen. This method ensures consistency in form and promotes steady progress while minimising the risk of injury. The latter part is particularly important, as utilising finger-training equipment like hangboards are known to increase the risk of injury if not performed with proper technique and control.

The equipment I use is primarily the hangboard [Beastmaker 2000](https://www.beastmaker.co.uk/products/beastmaker-2000-series) and the 'gymnastic rings' [Penta from YY Vertical](https://www.yyvertical.com/en/products/penta).

For exclusively exercising core, I follow [this programme](https://haavard.netlify.app/content/blog/other_thoughts_and_notes/coreprogramme). This is mostly relevant in periods where I have injured fingers or such.

<content-table :headers="['Exercise', 'Primary Muscle Groups', 'Sets and Repetitions | Time', 'Additional Comments']" :rows="[
    ['Pullup', 'Lats, Rhom, Biceps, Traps, Rotator Cuffs*', '4 Sets for 12 Reps', ''],
    ['Lying Legraise', 'Abs (Rectus Abd.), Hip Flexors', '4 Sets for 20 Reps', ''],
    ['Sideplank', 'Obliques (Int. and Ext.), Abs (Transverse Abd. and Rectus Abd.*), Glutes*', '4 Sets for 45 Seconds per Side', ''],
    ['Bicycle Situps', 'Abs (Rectus Abd.), Hip Flexors', '4 Sets for 20 Reps', ''],
    ['Hangboard', 'Forearms (Flexors and Extensors), Finger Flexors', '10s/8s On/Off for 6 Mini-sets', 'Holds used: 0 Degree Sloper, 4 Finger Crimp (20mm), 20 Degree Sloper, Elbow-Locked 4 Finger Crimp (20mm). Previously used holds includes 4 Finger Crimp (10mm), Big 2 Finger Pockets'],
    ['Flutterkicks', 'Abs (Rectus Abd.), Hip Flexors', '4 Sets for 50 Reps', ''],
    ['Hanging Kneetuck', 'Abs (Rectus Abd.), Hip Flexors, Forearms(Flexors and Extensors)*', '4 Sets for 12 Reps', ''],
]">
</content-table>

These sessions are frequently updated based on my progress and evolving needs. As I improve and certain exercises become less effective at providing muscle stimulus, I make adjustments to ensure continued growth and avoid plateaus. Additionally, if I identify weak spots, either in my own performance or within the exercises themselves, I modify the routine accordingly. For instance, I plan to alter the session soon to better target specific abdominal muscles, such as the obliques, ensuring a more comprehensive workout and addressing any imbalances.


##### Bouldering Sessions
My bouldering sessions are structured to progressively enhance my climbing performance through these varying levels of difficulty. I frequently adjust the focus and difficulty of the problems I work on based on my current performance and specific needs. For instance, if I find that certain grades no longer provide sufficient challenge or if I need to target specific techniques, I modify the session accordingly. This ensures that my training remains effective and aligned with my climbing goals, continually pushing my limits while addressing any areas that need improvement. 

When I refer to low-, middle-, and high-grade problems, I’m speaking based on my own personal performance levels. Problems rated 3 to 6A are relatively easy for me and serve as a foundation for warming up and refining technique. In contrast, problems rated 6B+ to 7A present a considerable challenge, pushing the limits of my strength and technical skills. Viewing the grading of problems as such helps me tailor my training sessions to effectively address different aspects of my climbing abilities.

<content-table :headers="['Training Phases', 'Description', 'Time', 'Additional Comments']" :rows="[
    ['Stretching', 'A lighter version of my Mobility Sessions', '10-15 Minutes', ''],
    ['Warm-up', 'Low-grade problems (3 to 6A) - Specifically focus on warming up legs and shoulders', '10-20 Minutes', ''],
    ['Technique-focused Climbing', 'Commonly middle-grade problems (5+ to 6B), particularly technique-heavy problems, with larger focus on `Silent Movements` and generally good technique', 'Minimum 30 Minutes', ''],
    ['Grade-chasing', 'High-grade problems (6B+ to 7A) where I focus on pushing my strength and technique', '30-45 Minutes', ''],
    ['Cool-down', 'A gradual decrese from Middle- to Low-grade problems (6B to 5)', '10-15 Minutes', ''],
    ['Stretching', 'A lighter version of my Mobility Sessions', '10-15 Minutes', ''],
]">
</content-table>

Recently, I have also attempted to incorporate a Min-5-approach to my bouldering sessions, specifically the Technique-focused phase and Grade-chasing phase. The idea is to give yourself minimum 5 attempts to solve a bouldering-problem, regardless of its difficulty. Additionally, for each attempt, regardless of how far I advanced on the problem, I am to give at least two pieces of feedback to myself on how to further advance on the problem. These could be observations on body positions, grip technique, balance, or other technical aspects. This 'self-assessment' forces me to analyse what went right or wrong in each try, thereby improving both my technique and my ability to read bouldering problems. 

The requirement of minimum 5 attempts, on the other hand, is to avoid the mindset of prematurely throwing in the towel on a problem, concluding it is too difficult without giving it a proper attempt. Often, I find myself quick to judge a problem based on its initial appearance or my first attempt, and by committing to multiple, proper attempts, I may move past the opening doubts and frustrations, forcing myself to keep an open mind and challenge myself beyond what I might think I can achieve at first glance. Persistence, embracing trial and error, and being open to experimentation beyond initial expectations is what lies at bouldering's, and rock-climbing in general's core, and by limiting myself with few, half-hearted attempts, I risk stifling my growth as a climber. Each attempt, even if it feels unsuccessful, contributes to my understanding of the route, my own capabilities, and how I may improve.


#### Other things to be included in the future

Unfortunately, I do not have more time available to spend on exercise without it affecting time spent on other hobbies, personal projects, friends and family. However, if available time and reasoning presented itself, I would experiment with:
- A balance-focused session. Something that would be held independent from the mobility and climbing-focused sessions, and likely provide a decent amount of benefits. 

Other "aspects" of the my exercise-plan to be noted: 
- The core section of the `Interval Core- and Finger-exercises` will be revised, as it currently is quite sub-optimal.
- I will likely experiment with moving away from having my rest-day on Mondays, to instead having it mid-week (Either Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).
