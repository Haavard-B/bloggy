title: Current Exercise-plan

In designing my exercise plan, I aim to cover most aspects of what you would consider a well-rounded, balanced approach to exercise, albeit with an intense schedule. I have broken my routine into four key areas: Gym, Cardio, Mobility and Climbing-focused exercises. Each play of these are independent of one another, serving its own purpose and with its own specific goals. While I do not exercise to achieve any explicit or significant goals, I know each area and their respective sessions will benefit me in some way down the road, and I thereby utilise goal-setting to motivate myself to improve in each singular session. 

Considering the intensity of the sessions of each exercise-area, I view my overall exercise-methodology to be flexible and non-dogmatic. The exercise-plan is never fully set in stone, and is adjustable to account for injuries and changes in general health, shifts in schedule, and other factors. Although the weekly exercise-schedule is initially planned at the start of each week or the end of the previous week, it may be modified when needed. This approach ensures my own discipline towards the plan, as well as the plan's effectivity. 

Throughout each week, I make sure to meticulously note down the details of each session, including the specific weights, sets and repetitions performed. I utilise these notes to ensure [progressive overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload) by reviewing my notes in advance of each session. This allows me to easily swap out insufficient exercises and systematically increase the intensity of my workouts by making incremental adjustments based on my notes, ensuring that I am consistently pushing my limits and promoting continuous improvements.

With these ideas in mind, I will now explore the specifics of my routine. In the following sections, I will provide a detailed breakdown of each key area, highlighting how they contribute to my overall fitness goals, as well as provide thorough insights into the structure of my weekly plan. For a deeper dive into my motivation, methodology and the principles guiding my exercise strategy, feel free to reed about [my exercise philosophy](https://haavard.netlify.app/content/blog/other_thoughts_and_notes/workoutphilosophy).

The following table outlines my weekly exercise schedule before any potential adjustment:

#### Gym
I structure my gym sessions into three primary groups: `Chest, Shoulders and Triceps`, `Back and Biceps` and ` Legs`. This approach allows me to focus intensively on specific muscle groups while providing ample recovery time before targeting the same areas again. By concentrating on different muscle groups each session, I can easily ensure that each group receives the attention needed, as well as a balanced workout each week. 

These session are the cornerstones of my exercise-plan. I avoid dropping a gym-session at almost any cost and refuse to have a relatively 'weak performance' in these sessions given my body 'allows' it, and will instead adjust every other session around them. For instance, as of 09.09.2024, I am dealing with knots in each calves, limiting the intensity and methods used to train them. To manage this, I will opt for eve-lower-intensity cardio session and mobility-sessions with a larger focus on calves, ensuring that I can push myself more effectively in my gym-sessions. This approach allows me to maintain the integrity of my gym-sessions while adapting to any temporary challenges, ensuring consistent progress and performance across my exercise-plan,

For each session, I am to perform 3-4 sets per exercise, opting for 3 sets if I am feeling more fatigued and 4 sets otherwise. I typically work within the 8-12 repetition range, and if I find myself reaching 12 reps for 3-4 sets, I will increase the weight until I can perform a minimum of 6-8 repetition for the same number of sets. Specifically, six repetition are mostly reserved for specific 'compound' exercises such as pulldowns and belt squats, where this range is more suitable to maximise strength and muscle engagement.

I also emphasise a progressive approach to warming up and increasing weights before hitting the target weight for each exercise during each session. For example, if I plan to do 90kg pulldowns, I start with lighter weights - 10kg, then 40kg, followed by 60kg - before finally reaching 90kg. I perform one set at each weight increment, gradually building up to the target weight for that session. During these warm-up sets, I typically work within a repetition range of 6-12. This approach ensures a proper technique and gradually prepares the muscles and joints for heavier loads, reducing the risk of injury. 

[Drop sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_set) are also frequently incorporated into my training regimen, particularly as the final 1-2 sets for specific exercises. After pushing an exercise to failure, or in some cases past it by performing several half-repetitions, I reduce the weight and continue the set, which allows me to push through the last bit of exhaustion. This technique not only intensifies the workout but also helps me feel like I have maximised my efforts and thoroughly fatigued my muscles.

The following sub-chapters provide a detailed description of each primary group:
( * refers to it being a 'secondary' muscle group utilised in the exercise, and DS = Inclined to using drop-sets in the exercise)
(There may be faults in the 'Primary Muscle Groups' categorisation)

In the future, when my back is fully functional again, I will experiment with lever/pendulum squats for better quad activation.

#### Climbing-focused Exercises
My Climbing-focused is split into `Interval Core- and Finger-exercises`, where I on strength and conditioning, and `Bouldering Sessions`, where I work through a structured programme to improve my general climbing skills. 


##### Interval Core- and Finger-exercises
For my Core and Finger-exercises, I incorporate interval training with 4 cycles, where I focus on maintaining proper and controlled techniques throughout. In these exercises the aim is not push myself to technical failure, but instead to adhere to a standardised and strict regime. This method ensures consistency in form and promotes steady progress while minimising the risk of injury. The latter part is particularly important, as utilising finger-training equipment like hangboards are known to increase the risk of injury if not performed with proper technique and control.

The equipment I use is primarily the hangboard [Beastmaker 2000](https://www.beastmaker.co.uk/products/beastmaker-2000-series) and the 'gymnastic rings' [Penta from YY Vertical](https://www.yyvertical.com/en/products/penta).

<content-table :headers="['Exercise', 'Primary Muscle Groups', 'Repitition | Time', 'Additional Comments']" :rows="[
    ['Pullup', 'Lats, Rhom, Biceps, Traps, Rotator Cuffs*', '12 Reps', ''],

    ['Hanging Kneetuck', 'Abs (Rectus Abd.), Hip Flexors, Forearms(Flexors and Extensors)*', '12 Reps', ''],
]">
</content-table>



##### Bouldering Sessions


When I write low-, middle- and high-grade problems, I refer to my own personal performance. 3 to 6A is what I consider relatively easy for myself, whereas 6B+ to 7A is quite difficult.

<content-table :headers="['Training Phases', 'Description', 'Time', 'Additional Comments']" :rows="[
    ['Stretching', 'A lighter version of my Mobility Sessions', '10-15 Minutes', ''],
    ['Warm-up', 'Low-grade problems (3 to 6A) - Specifically focus on warming up legs and shoulders', '10-20 Minutes', ''],
    ['Technique-focused Climbing', 'Commonly middle-grade problems (5+ to 6B) with larger focus on `Silent Movements` and generally good technique', 'Minimum 30 Minutes', ''],
    ['Grade-Chasing', 'High-grade problems (6B+ to 7A) where I focus on pushing my strength and technique', '30-45 Minutes', ''],
    ['Cool-down', 'A gradual decrese from Middle- to Low-grade problems (6B to 5)', '10-15 Minutes', ''],
    ['Stretching', 'A lighter version of my Mobility Sessions', '10-15 Minutes', ''],

#### Other things to be included in the future

Unfortunately, I do not have more time available to spend on exercise without it affecting time spent on other hobbies, personal projects, friends and family.
