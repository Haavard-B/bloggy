In designing my exercise plan, I aim to cover most aspects of what you would consider a well-rounded, balanced approach to exercise, albeit with an intense schedule. I have broken my routine into four key areas: Gym, Cardio, Mobility and Climbing-focused workouts. Each play of these are independent of one another, serving its own purpose and with its own specific goals. While I do not exercise to achieve any explicit or significant goals, I know each area and their respective sessions will benefit me in some way down the road, and I thereby utilise goal-setting to motivate myself to improve in each singular session. 

Considering the intensity of the sessions of each exercise-area, I view my overall exercise-methodology to be flexible and non-dogmatic. The exercise-plan is never fully set in stone, and is adjustable to account for injuries and changes in general health, shifts in schedule, and other factors. Although the weekly exercise-schedule is initially planned at the start of each week or the end of the previous week, it may be modified when needed. This approach ensures my own discipline towards the plan, as well as the plan's effectivity.
