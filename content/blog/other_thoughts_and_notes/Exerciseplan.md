In designing my exercise plan, I aim to cover most aspects of what you would consider a well-rounded, balanced approach to exercise, albeit with an intense schedule. I have broken my routine into four key areas: Gym, Cardio, Mobility and Climbing-focused exercises. Each play of these are independent of one another, serving its own purpose and with its own specific goals. While I do not exercise to achieve any explicit or significant goals, I know each area and their respective sessions will benefit me in some way down the road, and I thereby utilise goal-setting to motivate myself to improve in each singular session. 

Considering the intensity of the sessions of each exercise-area, I view my overall exercise-methodology to be flexible and non-dogmatic. The exercise-plan is never fully set in stone, and is adjustable to account for injuries and changes in general health, shifts in schedule, and other factors. Although the weekly exercise-schedule is initially planned at the start of each week or the end of the previous week, it may be modified when needed. This approach ensures my own discipline towards the plan, as well as the plan's effectivity. 

With these ideas in mind, I will now explore the specifics of my routine. In the following sections, I will provide a detailed breakdown of each key area, highlighting how they contribute to my overall fitness goals, as well as provide thorough insights into the structure of my weekly plan. For a deeper dive into my motivation, methodology and the principles guiding my exercise strategy, feel free to reed about [my exercise philosophy](https://haavard.netlify.app/content/blog/other_thoughts_and_notes/workoutphilosophy).

The following table outlines my weekly exercise schedule before any potential adjustment:

I also ensure that i continiously increase to progressively overload, and keeps notes on how much i do on each exercise, for may sets and reps. Primarely related to Gym and Climbing-focused exercises


#### Gym

3-4 sets on everything (3 if im feeling bad and am tired, 4 else)
8-12 reps usually, where if im at 12 x 3-4 sets then increase weight till i can do at min. 6-8 reps x 3-4. 6 Reps are only accepted at certian exercises (such as pulldown and belt squats)

Also focuses on building up the weights. So if I want to take 90kg pulldowns, i start iwht 10kg, then 40kg, then 60kg, then 90kg, one set each up until 90kg. The more weight i want to take, the more stages up till that  point. I do this to ensure good technique and that nothing hurts

#### Climbing-focused exercises

Equipment used: Beastmaker 2000 + YY Penta + A plank

4 cycles
focus is on proper and controlled techniques - The goal here is not to focus on pushing myself to technical failure, hence the standardised and 'strict' regime
