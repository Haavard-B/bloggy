# One task at a time

Having too many tasks leads to a lot of context switching which will dread your mind.

- Working iteratively will in the long run make you more efficient

# Things will change

Don't start working on something from start to finish.
The requirements **will** change.
Make sure you don't let your time and energy go to waste.

# Be patient

Only do something at the perfect time.
This will mean there will come a time where the best action is to do nothing

Accept that you won't be able to speed through and solve everything at once.


No matter how fast you work, it will all be completed at the appropriate time.
You should do it the right way, not the fast way.


If you have to wait for one of your features to go through QA in order to continue on another task, then your job as a **professional** is to be patient.

- Patience is a virtue
