he doesn't move from

"in development" to "testing"

he moves like this

"it is in development" to "it is done being developed"

"it is in testing" to "it is done being tested"

- have a check to verify they are doing what they are supposed to do
    - done rules


- Kanban is there to help you manage work that will take a few days
    - if it just takes 10 minutes you don't need to waste time putting it into the kanban 


WIP LIMIT on every step

estimation is easy

- bugs
    - if simple
        -  do it
    - if larger
        - break it down


estimating tasks
    - how many tasks would that break into ?
        - sum up

due date
    - we stopped with due dates ?
    - they were so smooth they didn't need to ask for estimates

THEY DON'T DO SPRINT PLANNING : O
    - what if they get a task with a due date ?
        - that rarely happens. due dates are often put on tasks which are not important
        
        
what if things are blocked ?
    - add it on the "track board"
        - Do what you can to drive it into being unblocked
        
- focus on what is blocked
    - it already says what you are working on at the kanban board
