Refactoring is not a linear payoff. It will gradually pay off.

Maintaining high code quality is a race you will never win.
It is an endless loop where the definitin of healthy code changes every time new unexpected requiriements occur.

You **HAVE TO** accept this, or else your life will be miserable.

Refactoring will never lead to perfect code, but it can lead to good enough code.

## When should we refactor ?
- Before implementing a new feature
- If the code is read tweny times a day, but hard to understand
- Repetetive code

## Refactoring for the sake of the developers 
- higher moral
- increase speed of delivering features
- stability
- confidence
- domain understanding
- Clean code will bring value to the customers in the long run.
- the future of the project will benefit from clean code

All these points have a direct correlation with producing customer value.
To say that refactoring in itself gives no value to the customers is wrong.
