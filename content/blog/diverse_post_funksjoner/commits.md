## Benefits of small commits

- earlier feedback
- Smaller risk
- It reduces chances of introducing bugs
- Non-blocking for other developers
- Speeds up product development

## What commits should achieve

- Should be revertable
- Should clearly indicate what and why something has changed

## Commit size

- The shorter time it takes to review code, the quicker it can be merged with master
- 250+ lines statistically take **1+ hour** to review
- Several studies show that it is harder to find bugs when reviewing a lot of code

## Other reasons for keeping it small 

- Quality of deliveries is directly related to the size of Pull Requests
- Lead Time is directly related to the size of Pull Requests
