Find out what does not give value and remove it

If your team can only complete 10 tasks every week, what is the point of 200 tasks ?
Requirements and focus will change, which will probably make it so you never complete those tasks.

- Does 1000 tasks in the backlog add value ? If not then remove them. (Mary Poppendieck)
- As little work in progress as possible
- make it clear for everything what is ongoing
- Keep an eye open, as waste grows slowly without you noticing.
- Waste is expensive and slows you down

A tight feedback loop also means having little in the backlog.
