## Stepping on your own toes

A pattern i have seen many times is people making a feature in one branch, then branching out in order to work on their next feature *(This is something i used to do)*.
What happens too often is the parent branch needed more changes, thus causing a downwards ripple effect.

Unless that branch and its commits are merged with master there is always a chance for breaking changes to occur.
I would not build my house on ground that could suddenly turn into lava.

The reason this happens is because they want to continue to type on their keyboard in order to create value.
Value is not made by typing furiously for 6 hours straight.
Value is made by producing good results.

Using speed to determine your worth is not a healthy mindset.
It is ok not to poop out a feature every minute.
