Predicting business cycles has long been considered the "holy grail" of economic forecasting. These cycles—marked by periods of expansion followed by contraction—are influenced by a complex web of factors, including consumer behaviour, fiscal policies, and global events. Traditional models, such as time series analysis or leading economic indicators, have provided some insights but often fail to offer reliable, consistent predictions. The core challenge is that economic systems are inherently nonlinear, unpredictable, and subject to abrupt shifts. These models rely heavily on historical data, which may not fully capture unforeseen disruptions, leaving economists struggling to pinpoint the exact timing of economic turns.

While machine learning (ML) may not be the silver bullet for predicting business cycles, it certainly offers new tools that could improve our understanding and forecasting capabilities. Unlike traditional models, ML can analyse vast amounts of data and uncover patterns that are often too complex or nonlinear for older methods to detect. By processing data from a variety of sources—ranging from economic indicators and financial markets to unconventional data like social media trends or even satellite data—ML can help build a more nuanced view of economic activity. In terms of prediction, ML’s strength lies in its adaptability. These models can learn from historical data to identify subtle signals, often too subtle for 'the human eye' too see, which could point to changes in the business cycle, potentially catching early shifts that traditional models might overlook. Moreover, ML algorithms can continuously update as new data becomes available, allowing for more timely adjustments to forecasts. This makes them particularly useful in environments where rapid changes are common and real-time analysis is essential.

While ML offers promising new tools for predicting business cycles, it is far from a flawless solution. While its ability to process large datasets and uncover complex, nonlinear patterns can enhance traditional models, it also comes with notable limitations. One key issue is overfitting, where models become too reliant on historical data, potentially missing new economic dynamics that were not present in the past. Though, it may be noted how this is also a notable restriction amongst more traditional predictive methodologies. Continuing, many ML models operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to interpret the reasoning behind their predictions—an important consideration for policymakers and analysts who need both accuracy and transparency. Data quality also poses a challenge, as machine learning predictions are only as good as the data they’re trained on, and economic data can often be noisy, incomplete, or subject to revisions. While ML can certainly improve business cycle forecasting, it is best seen as a complementary tool that should work alongside traditional models to balance adaptability with interpretability.

As to why I want to pursue a project like this, it stems from how I find many modern papers on this specific topic, with a lack of a better word, inadequate. They tend to focus heavily on either the macroeconomic perspective or on the technical details of machine learning (ML), rarely finding a middle ground. Papers that explore macroeconomic trends often neglect the potential of ML to provide new, data-driven insights, while those that dive into ML tend to overlook the broader economic context, concentrating more on the computational side without addressing its practical relevance to economic forecasting. This leaves a noticeable gap in the literature, where few studies successfully integrate both perspectives. I believe there's an opportunity to bridge this divide by developing models that harness the predictive power of ML while staying deeply rooted in economic theory, creating a more holistic approach to understanding and forecasting business cycles.

##### What are business cycles anyways?

A business cycle, commonly also referred to as an economic cycle, refers to the natural rise and fall of economic activity in a country, marked by periods of growth and decline. It affects key areas like GDP, employment, and income, with expansions boosting the economy and contractions slowing it down. While these cycles repeat, their timing is unpredictable, making them crucial to understanding the broader economic landscape.

A business cycle moves through four distinct stages: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough, as illustrated in the simplified picture below. During expansion, the economy grows steadily—output increases, unemployment falls, and consumer spending rises. This phase is marked by optimism, with businesses ramping up investment and production to meet demand, leading to broad economic gains. Continuing, at the peak, growth hits its highest point. The economy operates at full capacity, with high levels of employment and production, but inflation may rise as demand outpaces supply. This phase signals that the economy is about to slow down, leading to contraction. In the contraction stage, economic activity declines—output shrinks, unemployment rises, and consumer spending drops. If prolonged, this may result in a recession. Finally, the trough represents the lowest point, where the economy stabilizes and recovery begins, setting the stage for the next expansion, as shown in the image below.

##### And why are they difficult to predict?
Business cycles are notoriously difficult to predict because of the complex and interconnected factors that drive them. Various influences—such as consumer behaviour, fiscal policies, global events, and technological changes—make it challenging to determine when an economy will transition from one phase to another. These factors often interact in nonlinear ways, meaning that even small changes can have unexpectedly large effects, while larger changes might not produce the anticipated impact. Furthermore, many of these influences are hard to quantify, and finding consistent, reliable measures can be a major obstacle. Traditional forecasting models typically rely on historical data, but economic conditions can be sensitive to unforeseen disruptions, like financial crises, geopolitical events, or rapid technological shifts, which historical trends simply will not capture. This unpredictability, along with the difficulty in accurately measuring key economic indicators, makes it challenging to forecast the timing and severity of business cycle phases.

However, that’s not to say it’s impossible to make predictions. Will machine learning perfectly predict these cycles? No. But the potential of machine learning to analyse vast amounts of data and uncover hidden patterns makes it a fascinating avenue to explore. By improving our understanding of economic dynamics, ML could improve our forecasting capabilities, even if it doesn’t provide flawless predictions.
