## What defines a good task?

- Measurable and clear goals
- Easy to understand
- Easy to know when task is done
- Possible to complete within reasonable time
- Affected people should get the opportunity to share their thoughts


The last thing that should be done when defining a task or story is to write code
as it  is a very expensive acticity.
By waiting as long as possible you reduce the risk of having to redo something

code is an asset that cost money to own and maintain.

## When implementing a new feature

- verify it's working and write tests in orer to verify it is working tomorrow.
- someone not attached to the written code should look for corner cases and verify. Corner cases should then be turned into tests as well.
- embrace the fact that bugs are unavoidable. Work towards detecting as many as possible.
  - Create a system that is easy to debug.
