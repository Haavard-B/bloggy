Will write more, but the basic idea is: Investors love firms that focus on EITHER ESG or AI, but do not like those who say they focus on both. This is likely due to reasons such as hypocrisy (as ESG and AI contradict oen another), relatively poor reporting on either if you attempt to report on both, and firms coming across as Steve Buscemi in 30 Rock desperatively attempting to follow trend (and its more they say they do all the 'cool stuff', but in reality they barely do anything)
