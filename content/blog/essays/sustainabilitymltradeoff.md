title: The ESG-AI Trade-off
readable: false
---

Will write more, but the basic idea is: Investors love firms that focus on EITHER ESG or AI, but do not like those who say they focus on both. This is likely due to reasons such as hypocrisy (as ESG and AI contradict oen another), relatively poor reporting on either if you attempt to report on both, and firms coming across as Steve Buscemi in 30 Rock desperatively attempting to follow trend (and its more they say they do all the 'cool stuff', but in reality they barely do anything) (This may also be related to the firm's age cycle - See Musings on markets post on this)

Notes to write from:
- Profit-Purpose trade-off
- ESG and AI are fundamentally contradictory
- Dilution of focus (See musings on markets posts on aging corproations and how they try to follow new trends to keep themselves alive)
    - Both AI and ESG are relatively long-term oriented as well
- Investors' preference for authenticity and clarity, as well as one singular focus (investores loves this) | Market perception and brand identity
    - ESG and AI pulls completely different investors | Shareholder expectations
- Organisational challenges (You need to employ quite a lot of resources in either directions)
    - Cultural and organisational fit
