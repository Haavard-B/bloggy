title: Creatine works but...

Here are some resources for those sceptical and for those saying "Det er ingen forskning som viser at det fungerer. Null." (You know who you are).

Creatine is a compound found in muscle cells that helps produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy source for short bursts of high-intensity exercise. By increasing ATP levels through, amongst other sources, creatine supplements, you may experience:
- Increased strength and power (Enhanced Performance in high-intensity activities);
- Enhanced muscle mass (Greater muscle growth and water retention);
- Improved muscle recovery (Faster recovery adn reduced muscle damage); and
- Potential cognitive benefits (Possible improvements in short-term memory and focus)

These effects are well documented, and for further information, here are various scientific studies and expert reviews that provide in-depth insights into the benefits and mechanisms of creatine supplemtation (You may find more by searcing "Creatine" in either Google or Google Scholar):
- Casey, A., & Greenhaff, P. L. (2000). Does dietary creatine supplementation play a role in skeletal muscle metabolism and performance? American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 72(2), 6075-6175.

(The paper finds that creatine supplementation effectively enhances exercise performance and training adaptations, increasing muscle creatine and phosphocreatine levels, with most studies reporting significant improvements in strength and power)
- Hall, M., & Trojian, T. H. (2013). Creatine supplementation. Current Sports Medicine Reports, 12(4), 240-244. (The paper finds that creatine monohydrate enhances high-intensity exercise performance with a typical dosing regimen of 3 g/day for 5-7 days, followed by a maintenance dose. It is generally safe, though it may cause temporary water retention, and excessive use can lead to potential liver and kidney issues)
- Graham, A. S., & Hatton, R. C. (1999). Creatine: A review of efficacy and safety. Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association (1996), 39(6), 803-810. (The paper notes that creatine enhances high-intensity, short-duration exercise but is not effective for endurance sports)

However, that’s not to say that creatine is some sort of miracle supplement. Various papers and field experts emphasize that while creatine is effective for certain performance and therapeutic applications, its benefits are not universal and may vary based on individual response, type of exercise, or specific health conditions. Additionally, creatine supplementation comes with risks, such as potential kidney issues and adverse effects from improper use. Here are some resources pointing out and addressing such concerns:
- Graham, A. S., & Hatton, R. C. (1999). Creatine: A review of efficacy and safety. Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association (1996), 39(6), 803-810. (This is a paper from the pro-list above. It also highlights concerns about the quality and consistency of commercially available creatine products, which may pose risks such as potential renal dysfunction)

(The paper reviews the benefits of creatine monohydrate, including increased muscle mass and neural protection, while also addressing potential risks. It highlights side effects such as muscle cramping and concerns about impurities. Despite these issues, the paper concludes that the side effects are generally mild and manageable, and there is no strong evidence of significant mutagenic or carcinogenic risks. Overall, the benefits of creatine often outweigh the risks for most users when used as directed)

The review assesses the adverse effects of creatine monohydrate, finding that while mild side effects like gastrointestinal issues and muscle cramps are occasionally reported, there is no substantial evidence of significant liver or kidney damage from creatine use. Regular monitoring is recommended to ensure safety, particularly with long-term or high-dose use)

As a last note, multiple papers also point to how creatine may be associated with accelareted hair loss. So that kind of sucks.
