title: Creatine Works

Here are some resources for those sceptical and for those saying "Det er ingen forskning som viser at det fungerer. Null".

Creatine is a compound found in muscle cells that helps produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy source for short bursts of high-intensity exercise. By increasing ATP levels through, amongst other sources, creatine supplements, you may experience:
- Increased strength and power (Enhanced Performance in high-intensity activities);
- Enhanced muscle mass (Greater muscle growth and water retention);
- Improved muscle recovery (Faster recovery adn reduced muscle damage); and
- Potential cognitive benefits (Possible improvements in short-term memory and focus)

These effects are well documented, and for further information, here are various scientific studies and expert reviews that provide in-depth insights into the benefits and mechanisms of creatine supplemtation:

American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 72(2), 607S-610S. https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/72.2.607S (This study found that creatine supplementation enhances short-term, high-intensity exercise performance by increasing muscle phosphocreatine levels and improving ATP production during exercise)
