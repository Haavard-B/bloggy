- the 99% wants a 100% methodical system
- the 99% wants to always be in a trade
- To succeed you need to do what most people are not willing to do
- Add brain and intuition to your trades
- The mind will jump to conclusions
- The market is not a supermarket
- Profit targets is what 99% focus on
- will you ever reach your potential? "stop staring at the chart and start cultivating a different mindset"

## Improve journaling

- always write down current risk and risk of each entry. then you don't have to waste time looking back in the logs (which is quite hard to do)
