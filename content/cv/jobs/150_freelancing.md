After getting a taste of what programming was, I wanted to keep doing it. 
I did not know where to start or what tasks I could do, so I started freelancing.
This was a way of having new things to work with and challenges
to overcome.

I found it facinating that it was possible to earn money programming.
*(Also it was fun to earn some money)*

Freelancing gave me many valuable lessons.
