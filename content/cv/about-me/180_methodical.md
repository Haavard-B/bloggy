I've spent many years reading and testing out different approaches and my daily life is heavily influenced by the methods and philosophy of these principles.


## Lean

I am a big fan.

## Agile

I think Agile and Lean coexist, and are quite similar.

What is important is doing things efficiently and deliver value. In the end they are just buzzwords.

I could type about how I have read countless books on these topics and heroically used these principles at work to make my work easier and more efficient.

But being someone who truly follows these principles daily, I will keep it minimal.

## The Tao ?

I also think Lean/Agile are similar to the Tao, which is a Chinese philosophy about how the universe works.

All books about the Tao are quite minimal, and nobody wants to explain the Tao in too much detail, because if the Tao is written down, it is not the Tao.

In order to learn the Tao, you need to realize what it is.

I think that is the best way to learn what Lean/Agile is as well.
