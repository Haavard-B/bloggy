I consider myself a highly experienced and knowledgeable person.

<ReadMore text="Do you want to know more?">

### Where does this confidence come from ?

- I've spen a lot of time testing out different patterns and understanding their upsides and downsides
- Working in large systems 
- Digging for golden nuggets of wisdom
- Going deep into what it means to write *"good"* code

### Quitting my job to improve my skills ?

Many people warned me about having a "hole in my CV", but I didn't worry about that.

Would they have said the same thing if i went back to school to study and improve my knowledge?

If improving yourself and your skills is what matters, then staying at my job or jumping straight into a new job would not be the right choice for me.

### Why quit ?

My motivation for quitting my job was to:

- reset my brain and hopefully get new perspectives on many topics
- Learn more about the art of software engineering

I have definitely succeeded at my goal, and I'm glad i let my brain take a step back and relax and hopefully even forget a few things which I can later reclaim from a new perspective.

### Too aggressive ?

The biggest excitement I have had in this field is when I learn something new and groundbreaking to my beliefs and ideas about software.

And as I have shown by my actions, I would gladly sacrifice financial stability to achieve this.
Some people would call this the hunt for the dopamine rush, and I can definitely agree that one reason is to get the dopamine hit of improving and learning something groundbreaking that changes my view once again on software.
