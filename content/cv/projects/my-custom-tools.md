My custom tools are quite epic.
If i didn't have them, it would be painful to work on my computer.

Some other things i started doing when i got tendonitis:

- Focusing more on how to achieve my goals with as little effort as possible. This led to a lot of improvements in my workflow.
- Using vim, and realize how powerful it is.
- Scripts to automate tedious tasks
- Setting up a bunch of terminal aliases

This is a continuous process. To this day I still improve my workflow or refine existing tools.
