Every person who writes code eventually ends up with writing their own framework.

I really like Flask.py, but it does not offer static site generation, and you also need to host your website on a server.

Because i don't want to bother with server hosting I created `Flesk.py`
which makes it possible to deploy to static site hosting services like Netlify.
