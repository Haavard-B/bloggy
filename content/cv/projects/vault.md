I now consider myself an extremely competent "person who is good at keeping track of things"

During my time at DNB, I read the book **"The art of stress-free productivity"** which changed my view on what it actually means to be **productive** and **on top of things**.

My first thought was "this is an old book", but the content is timeless.

## The vault

Since then i have spent many hours thinking, practiced and improved my way of handling all the things that needs to be done in life.

For many years I have been thinking *"A todo-app isn't enough to keep track of everything"*, so after many years I decided to make **The vault**, which is also just a todo app, but more focused on long-term tasks.

**The vault** is where i put todo tasks that will live on for a long time and has the following features.

### What is 'The vault'

Now that I think about it, even though i have written code and made it fancy, in the end it is just a simple todo-app, yet immensely powerful.

## Daily habit helper

There are many things you need to do every day.
I found that storing these in the todo app clutters it up quite a lot,
so i made a tool that sends me notifications whenever i want it to.

It can send daily, weekly, etc etc, whatever you want.

## Why all this?

There is a big quality of life improvement by keeping track of everything you need to do.
By doing this you offload a lot of work from your brain to what the book calls your "external brain", which leaves your actual brain in a more peaceful state.
