The selection of interesting and relevant reading material was declining during my final year at DNB.
I was still looking for ways to keep improving.

Writing texts was a good practise on how to communicate my ideas clearly.

*All my 'blog posts' on this site has been turned into personal notes and are not very structured.*

I made this blog using Nuxt.js, and my friend also uses it via my [blog wrapper](github.com/kristus123/blog-template) which makes it easy for him to make his own blog.
