To 黄羽涵

Happy birthday :D

I feel lucky to have met you and You have been a big part of my life.
Your strong mentality and way of thinking is impressive.
You are a true philosopher.

You are a positive girl, even though you have described yourself as a pesimistic person.
Though I am one year older, you have definetively matured much faster than me hihi.

Your friends are lucky to have you, and I also feel really lucky to have gotten to know you.

If I had not met you, my life would definetively not be as joyful as it is today.
Because of that I am grateful to have been able to spend all this time with you.

You make my days better and there are not many people like you.
你真了不起
