I had been programming for 4-5 years before getting my first job here at DNB.

With many years of programming experience, I was surprised on how little I knew
and how much my definition of a good programmer would change.

After many years I still feel there is much to learn
and many of the skills I have found to be important have nothing to do with writing code.

I will share some simple topics on how you can become a *"better programmer"*.
All very simple topics, but nonetheless important skills you must practise thoroughly if you wish to become more than just an *"average programmer"*.

<content-quote quote="A good [programmer] does what the best [programmer] would do" person="Aristotle" source="Nicomachean ethics" icon="mdi-book-open-page-variant">
</content-quote>

If we envision a 'perfect' programmer we can probably agree on a few key notes.

## The 'perfect' programmer

- Asks if unsure
- Always tries to improve
- Knows of his strenghts and weaknesses
- Open for change
- Enjoys programming
- Gets the job done
- *TL;DR* makes a solid solution 
- Lead
- Mentor and be mentored
- Able to pull out the **real** requirements of the project
- Work with and alongside project managers and business analysts

### NB!

There is no such thing as a *perfect programmer*.
According to Plato the *perfect programmer* does not exist, only the blueprint to define the *perfect programmer* that we can use to attempt to get as close as possible.

The goal is not to become a *perfect programmer*, but rather becoming the best programmer you can possibly be.

I am far from an expert, but my goal is to aim to become the best I can be.
Writing down my thoughts in blog posts like this helps me put things in perspective, and it is easy to get feedback from others.

## Becoming a better programmer

In the things I have mentioned, few are about the art of programming and engineering,
and more on fundamental habits and skills.
Though fundamental, they separate the average from the good.

### Asking for help and taking small steps

Small steps is at the heart of Agile, and planning things in small increments promotes flexibility.

Being able to react to changes as they occur is easier said than done,
but the earlier you get feedback the faster you can change course.


Taking small steps and asking for feedback will make it easy to move in the right direction.

Do not be afraid to ask for help. The more you know, the more confident you feel.

Ask whenever you have questions.
Eventually, you won't need to ask as much because your understanding of the domain grows.

### Don't start on a task which is not clear

Do not assume anything. Ask questions whenever something is unclear.

It is impossible to progress on a task when there is no way to know if you are heading in the right direction.

Progressing blindly will not lead you to the desired destination, unless you are ridiculously lucky.

### It is your job to guide the decisions in order to create a good solution


Your thoughts and opinions should help shape the solution.


### One step at a time

Trying to do too much at once will lead to you being overwhelmed.
You will not be able to spend your time efficiently if you are constantly changing which task you are working on.

Have a Lean mindset when it comes to how things are done. It will help you stay on top of things when things get tough.

### Calm mind

There is no need to fry your brain.
You must accept what is in your power to do, and what's not.

Nobody gains anything from you stressing over 

You should not let things affect your judgement.

### Good communication


`// todo : comment from redditor`

I am missing the part that you want to ensure that what you build matches other peoples expectations (both from your fellow coders as from other stakeholders). So one of the next most important parts of coding is trying to connect to others, imho.

### Accept failure

From a certain perspective, being a developer is a job in failure. We *"fail"* all the time.
Being able to manage the stress, imposter syndrome, and everything else is really important.

It is ok to make mistakes.

### No need for anger

![Yoda tells it](https://c.tenor.com/pBnEhrROUuEAAAAC/yoda-anger.gif)

### Consider the cost/benefit ratio

`todo write here`

Engineers, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test complex systems and structures to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost.

### Produce good results

A good solution can mean many things. It is scalable, maintainable, flexible, robust, secure, etc.
What you will end up prioritizing depending on the task at hand.

It is hard to predict the future, so knowing exactly what the project needs can be hard to answer and the needs will change rapidly throughout its life-cycle.

# Let's get sligthly more technical

Though this article is mostly non-technical,
there are some technical tips i want to mention for fun.

## Creating custom tools

This won't make you a better programmer but it will make life more chill.
That sounds like a good thing in my opinion.

I always thought it would be cool to have some custom scripts to simplify my workflow,
but I never had any reason to make any.

After getting tendinitis, I realized how much repetetive activities you do every day on your computer and i started focusing more on making my experience working on the computer simpler and more pleasant.

## Some examples on what I have done

Let's go over a few ways to make your day shine *0.5%* brighter.

### Optimizing your IDE

If I notice I do something which could be simplified, I spend time making it easier to do right away.
A good example is how I take advantage of Intellij's code completion features

![Code completion in Intellij example](https://i.gyazo.com/bac4721c16e047aa090fd1cd9d55c185.gif)

You can make tons of small macros which help you write code more comfortably.
When you notice you wish you had a small feature, create it right away.

If you say you will *"make that macro later"*, you will probably never do it. **Do it right away!**

### Making things easy to do

A tool I have been using in order to easily execute commands and scripts is [Ueli](https://ueli.app).

I often generate UUID's, open up projects, navigate to specific websites and start up local development environments.
These are all daily tasks that could be made simpler for you to execute.

![Ueli example of executing command](https://i.gyazo.com/61d90e6cf400d5d54b1426e36e7d993a.gif)

### Optimize your workflow

Everything you can come up with in order to make things more smooth is a good thing.
It can be anything from having a water bottle at your desk to bookmarking websites you visit often.

Be critical to your ingrained habits, as many of them has potential for improvement.
Once you realize how much time and energy you can save, you will be amazed.

## Conclusion

Train your mind. It is the most powerful tool you will ever have.

By this I don't necessarily mean that you should train your mind by reading programming books,
but more about strengthening your spirit.

Do not fear making mistakes. Mistakes are opportunities to improve.

Your physical body is more important than work.
Your mental health is more important than anything.

### What it means to be a good programmer   

There is much more to being a programmer than just coding.

Many years ago I thought that being a good programmer simply was to be extremely talented at programming.
Later on I learned that was not the case.

Programming is just one of many skillsets needed in order to be a good programmer.

</content-quote>


## Conclusion

keep the good beginner habits, and be open to change.
The world of software is as dynamic and ever-changing as evolution, though many thoughts and ideas will stand its test of time.
One skill that has definitely stood its test of time is to be kind to one another.

## Final words

Thank you for reading.

I have posted this on reddit, and gotten much feedback and many discussions :D

I even made a "page visit counter" since I was so amazed by how many people took a look at my blog post.
It is by human nature to enjoy seeing things grow and accumulate, so maybe in the future I will remove the "page visit counter" as it might only be a distraction.
